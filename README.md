# Ideal Gas Simulation

A simple web application that visually simulates particles in an ideal gas within a container. 
Users can adjust the number of particles and the temperature (which affects particle speed) using sliders.

## Features

-   Visual representation of gas particles.
-   Adjustable number of particles.
-   Adjustable temperature (particle speed).
-   Particle-wall collisions.
-   Particle-particle collisions (elastic).
-   Responsive canvas that adapts to container size.

## Technologies Used

-   HTML5
-   CSS3
-   JavaScript (ES6+)
-   p5.js library for graphics and interaction

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository or download the files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `sketch.js`).
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

No special build steps are required as it's a client-side application using CDN for p5.js.

## Controls

-   **Number of Particles Slider**: Adjusts the total number of particles in the simulation.
-   **Temperature (Speed) Slider**: Adjusts the average speed of the particles.
